p;Oh? A distress call! Some pilot must have been captured by the bugs on this dirt planet.
p;So much skill and confidence, and yet it only takes one mistake and your whole ship is a silky cocoon.
p;Even after so many years fighting these things, I still find them disgusting. But I love all the mix of colours and seeing them explode is like fireworks every time.
p;Looks like it's up to me to save this one. I can't wait for someone to talk to, I wonder if he's cute?
e;
p;Hello? I've come to rescue you!
a;What? Thank godness. I was sure I was going to be turned into soup.
p;(Oh wow he is cute) Uh, yes you would have most likely have been turned into soup. It still amazes me that these bugs can grow their own spacecrafts.
a;Yes, they use a crazy chemical to break down and metabolize metals and almost any other material. 
a;I guess that's what we get for creating organic robots to solve our waste and energy problems aye.
p;Although, without their origins, humanity wouldn't be exporing space!
p;You're right. So, now that I'm free, at least I can protect you from them.
p;Haha, the bugs are gross but they are fun to destroy. As long as you're careful and manage your supplies.
p;Oh that's good, because I actually can't stand them. Sounds like you can handle this on your own.
a;I could... but I'd love your company at least, I was just on my way to visit...
p;Uh... I'm not very spontaneous. I like to think I'm a pretty careful person, despite being captured...
a;Oh come on, would you rather be soup?
p;Well, if you put it that way, sure!
