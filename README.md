## Protips

Also a note: I know this game is hard, so some tips:

- Get up in enemy's faces to lessen bullet travel time
- Spread the screen with bullets when there are no enemies so when they do appear at the top of the scree they run into the bullets
- You have to figure out the best order to buy in the shop to balance firepower and shields for Alpha, so expect to lose a lot and try again - the game will start over but you get to choose your items more carefully from the start!
- Bombs are handy during a boss fight
- The weapons that are "always equipped" add that extra firepower you need

There are some other bugs that let you cheat but please at least try and get to level 5 without cheating.

No pause button sorry but it will pause when you change focus (or lock your screen).

## Changelog

- Fixed bug preventing level ending after first boss.
- Fixed bug preventing player taking damage.
